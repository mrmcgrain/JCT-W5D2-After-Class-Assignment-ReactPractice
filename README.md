React Practice Project

You are required to create a web application using React focused on showcasing your favorite learning books or websites. The application should allow users to explore and discover various educational resources recommended by you.

Project Requirements:

Landing Page:
   - Create a landing page for your application. The landing page should introduce your application's purpose and provide an overview of its features.

Navigation Functionality:
   - Implement navigation functionality to allow users to navigate between different sections of your application. For example, you could have separate pages for Books and Websites.

Topic Selection:
   - Choose your favorite learning books or websites as the focus of your application. Select a variety of resources across different topics or subjects to provide a diverse collection for users to explore.

Components:
   - Include at least two different components in your application. Each component should have its own state and props. For example, if you choose learning books, you could have components for displaying book details and adding new book recommendations.

JSX Syntax:
   - Utilize JSX syntax for rendering UI elements throughout your application. Use JSX to create the structure and layout of your application's pages and components.

Lifecycle Methods:
   - Implement at least one lifecycle method in one of your components. For example, you could use the componentDidMount method to fetch data from an external API when a component is mounted.

Optional: Redux Integration:
   - For an extra challenge, consider incorporating Redux for managing global application state. This is optional but recommended for those seeking to deepen their understanding of state management in React.

 

Project Deliverables:

GitHub Repository:
   - Create a GitHub repository for your React application. Include a detailed README.md file in the repository with the following information:

     - Overview of the project and its objectives.

     - Instructions for setting up and running the application locally.

     - Description of the project structure and organization of files.

     - Explanation of key components, including their functionality and usage.

     - Details of any external libraries or dependencies used in the project.

     - Instructions for accessing the deployed version of the application (if applicable).

     - Any additional information or considerations for reviewers.

Source Code:
   - Submit the source code of your React application to the GitHub repository. Make sure to organize your code into appropriate files and folders for clarity.

Documentation:
   - Provide documentation in the README.md file outlining the structure of your application. Include details about the components you created, how state is managed, any lifecycle methods implemented, and any additional features you included.
